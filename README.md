A simple and interactive **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game built using Python.  
The game uses random computer choices, user input handling, and classic RPS rules to determine the winner.  
This is a great beginner-friendly mini-project for learning Python loops, conditionals, and functions.

  - Paper beats Rock  
- Declares:
  - Winner  
  - Loser  
  - or **Tie**
